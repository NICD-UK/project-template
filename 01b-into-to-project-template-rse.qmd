## NICD Skills Projects

__NICD Skills Projects__ typically take the following form:

![](figures/skills-project.png){fig-align="center"}

Several different tools are used to streamline running of these projects, including: __Innovation Story Canvas__, __Sprint Cards__, __Project Charter__ and so on

## Motivation Behind the NICD Project Template

- NICD clients have expressed an interest in __automating project structure generation for data science__ 
- While there are existing project templates including [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) and [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net), these templates suffer from several __drawbacks__ (covered in the latter slides)
- Previously, there were two teams working independently on developing better project templates for data science; this project template attempts to __unify__ these efforts.

## What makes a good project template?

Aside from __automation__ and __reproducibility__, a good project template for data science should be:

1. _broadly applicable_
2. _encourage good practice_
3. _language agnostic_
4. _easy to use_
5. _compatible with the NICD workflow_

## 1. Broadly applicable

- The project template should reflect different data science products mentioned in the [Project Kick-off Slides](https://newcastle.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/DigitalInstitute581/Shared%20Documents/NICD/Activities/Data%20Skills/Project%20Kick-off?csf=1&web=1&e=3hgxin), i.e.

    - _description products_
    - _estimation and attribution products_
    - _prediction products_

- Most available project templates focus on __prediction products__ and thus, fail to satisfy this condition

## 2. Encourage good practice

- While flexibility is important, the project template needs to be reasonably opinionated to encourage good practice
- Good practice should start with:

    1. code version control
    2. package management
    3. project structure and organisation

- These three elements reflect the most pressing needs of the majority of NICD clients

## 3. Language agnostic

- The project template should be __language agnostic__ to accommodate different programming languages for data science
- At minimum, it should support __R__ and __Python__ since they are the most popular languages for data science
- [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) is solely Python-focussed and [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net) is solely R-focussed
- To our knowledge, only [govcookiecutter](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/govcookiecutter) is language agnostic but it is not straightforward to use

## 4. Easy to use

- The project template scripts should include some boilerplate code to allow the user to __quickly get started__ with their project and support __reproducibility__
- This boilerplate code should encourage the correct use of the project structure and organisation
- There should be __minimal user input__ required to:

    - generate the project structure and organisation
    - iniatlise a virtual environment
    - iniatlise a git repository

## 5. Compatible with the NICD workflow

- Most project templates have script directories like: `clean/`, `munge/`, `featurise/`. However, they do not provide guidance on exactly what scripts these directories should contain. Furthermore, these terminologies are used inconsistently across different project templates.
- The project template should be __compatible with the NICD workflow__ and provide guidance on how to use the project structure and organisation

## Current State-of-Play

Version 0.1.0 of the [NICD project template](https://github.com/NICD-UK/project-template) has the following features:

- data, scripts and reports are organised into __cleaning__ and __wrangling__, which are strictly defined
- template reports for describing __cleaned data__ and exploring __wrangled data__
- template scripts for __quarto presentations__
- usage of __scripts__ rather than __notebooks__
- integrated __project charter__
- __single, language agnostic command__ `make` to setup virtual environment and git repository 

## Usage

In the command line move to where you want to create the project directory and run:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/NICD-UK/project-template
```

You will be prompted for the:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
1. Project Name
2. Project Directory Name
3. Project Manager Name
4. Project Manager Email
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
5. Project Sponsor Name
6. Project Sponsor Email
7. Project Summary
8. Language: **Python** or **R**
:::
::::

## Usage

In the command line run:

```bash
make
```

This command will:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
1. Initialise a [reproducible environment](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/renv.html):
    - `venv` for Python
    - `renv` for R
2. Install the packages required for the template scipts
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
3. Save the packages to a dependencies file:
    - `requirements.txt` for Python
    - `renv.lock` for R
4. Initialise a git repository for [version control](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/vcs.html)

## Immediate Future

- Development of new features is managed through a [GitHub Projects Board](https://github.com/orgs/NICD-UK/projects/9)

- The following features are in the __backlog__:

    - configuration file for automation
    - data version control with [DVC](https://dvc.org)
    - formatting and linting with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com)
    - data pipelining with e.g. [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    - data science checklists for cleaning, wrangling and modelling
    - testing 
    - tagging

## Feedback

- We encourage you to provide feedback on the project template through the [Github Discussions](https://github.com/NICD-UK/project-template/discussions)
- We are also open to suggestions for new features
