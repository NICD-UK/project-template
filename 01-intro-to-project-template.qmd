## Background

- NICD clients have expressed an interest in __automating project structure generation for data science__ 
- While there are existing project templates including [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) for __Python__ and [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net) for __R__, these templates suffer from several __drawbacks__, such as:

    - _being language-specific_
    - _not enforcing latest good practice_
    - _being narrowly applicable_

- Previously, there were two teams working independently on developing better project templates for data science; this project template attempts to __unify__ these efforts.

## What makes a good project template?

Aside from __automation__ and __reproducibility__, a good project template for data science should be:

1. broadly applicable
2. encourage good practice
3. language agnostic
4. easy to use
5. compatible with the NICD workflow
